    "This notebook contains the different machine learning models on which the training data of the <i>food-101</i> dataset will be trained on. Algorithms with different complexities will be used here. Its always a good practice to start with simplest model and later trying complex ones. But before we get our hands dirty with modeling, one more step lies between EDA and modeling which is Feature Engineering. In a usual scenario, feature engineering should get its separate notebook but because the dataset is already clean, images are already arranged in proper folders, all food items have 1000 images(except for one data object as seen in EDA), and data is well split into training and test set so, there is not much to do in feature engineering. Also, if we have to make some changes in the dataset it might be based on the model we choose. "
